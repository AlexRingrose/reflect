## Why a Portfolio?
The portfolio reveals your growth over the course of the major. It highlights strengths and mastery of the goals expected of a history graduate.

It preserves a compilation of your best work to showcase for graduate, law school, or job interviews. It lets the history faculty see areas of strength in the program and identify trends to address in future years.

Timely submission of your portfolio is also a graduation requirement for all history majors. Trust us, the registrar will check before issuing your diploma!

## Program Goals
History program goals are skills all students should master by the time they graduate.

So, part of the portfolio asks you to use a selection of your papers to reflect on different program goals, such as understanding content from different periods and places, or using evidence to make a historical argument.

The idea is to assess each goal two ways: in a paragraph that shows how your work shows mastery, and by rating your accomplishment using a 4-point rubric.
